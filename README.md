New Discussion
Overall Schedule. 
What should we be doing? 
Notes
All group members prefer doing an operating system for now (flexibility, creativity, interestingness). 
Standups before proposal being submitted. 
Make use of this week to figure out what specifically do we need to do for this whole project as well as prepare for the proposal.
Proposal
Intro: Which topic did we choose? What components are we going to implement?
Inspiration: Where did we get our ideas from? Referred operating system. Resources. 
Work: What are we going to code (in more details).
Schedule
Work distribution: How are we going to assign our work? 
Questions to be answered
Do we need to rewrite a whole new system from scratch? Or we write some applications based on an existing operating system? 
What specifically do we need to code? What does the final program look like?
Weight: 30% or 40%?
Simulated kernel using low-level system APIs? Or fake GUI/TUI system as a program?

Questions
We use simulated to represent real memory, but what is used is the real CPU, how do we represent how CPU/memory is used?
